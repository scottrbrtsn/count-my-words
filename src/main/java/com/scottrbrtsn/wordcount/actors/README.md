Actor Notes
-----

I have only loose conceptual knowledge of actors, thought they seem powerful and useful.

I found 2 different implementations of akka in spring.  There seems to be some scope limitations compared to 
what I am used to.  I would have to spend some significant time integrating this into my current design, so I'm going to leave this
as is for now.  

It seems as though UntypedActor is deprecated, but it works to at least give me a foundation to learn from.  AbstractActor is a bit more obscure.
